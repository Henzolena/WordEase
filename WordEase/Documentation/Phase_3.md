# Phase 3 Documentation: Settings App + Data Sync

## Objective:

Develop a companion settings app to manage user preferences, tone settings, history, and login. Implement real-time data sync between the keyboard extension and the settings app using shared storage and optional cloud services.

---

## Timeline:

**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks

## Deliverables:

* SwiftUI or React Native-based companion app
* User login with Firebase Auth or Apple Sign-In
* Preferences management:

  * Preferred tone
  * Theme (light/dark/auto)
  * Typing language
  * AI behavior (auto-trigger, suggestion display style)
* Rewrites history viewer with search/filter/edit/delete
* Shared storage via App Group container
* Cloud sync via Firestore or Supabase (optional)

---

## Technical Scope:

### Development:

* Build SwiftUI interface (or React Native if preferred)
* Implement login/signup screen
* Create a preferences store with toggles and dropdowns
* Read/write preferences and history to App Group storage (accessible by both keyboard and settings app)
* Enable syncing preferences and history with Firebase Firestore if user is logged in

### UI/UX:

* Clean and intuitive layout with tab or segmented navigation
* Preferences screen with labeled sections and explanations
* History section with scrollable list, editable items, and clear timestamps
* Theme and language selection screen with immediate preview

---

## Testing Plan:

### Scope:

* Validate login/signup, logout flows
* Test writing and reading preferences from App Group storage
* Simulate sync conflicts between keyboard and settings app
* Check UI on various device sizes and iOS versions

### Data:

* Real user interaction data: tone changes, theme toggles, AI preferences
* History entries from real rewrite sessions (imported or locally generated)

---

## Acceptance Criteria:

* Preferences persist correctly and affect keyboard behavior
* History accurately reflects real usage and can be searched/edited
* Logged-in users see synced history and preferences on all devices
* App Group storage integration is stable and error-free
* UI is responsive, clean, and intuitive

---

## Next Phase Prerequisite:

* App successfully syncs preferences and history between app and keyboard
* Account login/logout tested and verified
* App Group communication fully functional

Upon completion, proceed to **Phase 4: Limits, Feedback, and Subscription Logic**.
